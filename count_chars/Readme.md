# Count Characters Exercise

This exercise involves implementing a function `count_chars` in Rust that compresses a string by counting consecutive characters and appending the count to each character. For example, the input string "aaabbbbbccccdaa" should be transformed into "a3b5c4d1a2".

The project includes a set of unit tests to verify the correctness of the function. To run the tests, use `cargo test`. The tests cover various cases, including empty strings, single characters, repeated characters, and mixed characters.
